# What:

Because it seems like it might provide some (idk) security benefits, and because it seemed like an intersting exercise, I wanted to figure out how to block any requests to a .zip url from my laptop.

# How:

This is the hard part that Iâ€™m not sure I fully figured out...

This is documenting what I did so far:

1. Installing bind9:

    ```shell
    dnf install bind
    ```

2. Updating/Creating various Config files:

    {{< code language="shell" lang="FILE" title="/etc/hosts" line-numbers="true" line="9-11" start="8" >}}
# ...
# Does not work
127.0.0.1  *.zip
::1        *.zip{{< /code >}}
    {{< code language="shell" lang="FILE" title="/etc/bindresvport.blacklist" line-numbers="true" line="12" >}}
#
# This file contains a list of port numbers between 600 and 1024,
# which should not be used by bindresvport. bindresvport is mostly
# called by RPC services. This mostly solves the problem, that a
# RPC service uses a well known port of another service.

3. Applying changes

    ```shell
    sudo service bind9 restart
    sudo service bind restart
    systemctl status named.service
    journalctl -xeu named.service

    nslookup zip
    nslookup url.zip

    sudo service network restart
    sudo service named restart
    ```
4. Cry because it has had no apparent effect
5. Reboot
